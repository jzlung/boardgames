# Welcome!

Hi there, my name is Jerry and welcome to the Big Board of Games! We are aiming to be the best board game resource and community around. Our goals are:
* To connect you with games you love and will love
* To connect you with people who love the games you do
It ain't much right now, but our immediate objective is to pump out content and start hooking you up with some sweet board games. Please check back often to learn about new games and sign up for our mailing list to stay in the know as we expand the site. Thanks for visiting!

<p>Game on,</p>
<p>Jerry</p>
