Galaxy Trucker Strategy

- Prioritize being first with a less-than-perfect ship rather than last with a perfect ship.
One concept I see new players not picking up fast enough is that speed (and thus, position) matters.
They proceed to miss out on the Abandoned Station/Ship missions, goods, and gunfights.
Being first means the game will throw money at you, so try to finish building as early as possible.
This is especially true in later rounds when the starting difference (and the finishing bonus) gets larger.

-- Corollary: Sometimes, sometimes, it's worth it to not take a mission to secure a favorable position.
This is dependent on:
* Probability of crew, goods, gunfight missions that you are able to capitalize on
* Probability of things that set you back (and nullify this advantage) like Stardust, Combat Zone
* If it's the last card, then finishing position


- Shields are not necessary in the first round.

With the first round not really presenting any threats above small meteors, shields are useless as long as you don't have open connections.

- Don't rely on 4-connectors to build off of
I used to have this insistence on starting my ship's core off with these pieces, thinking that it provided a flexible jumping board for the rest of my ship.
While this principle is true, what actually happened was that I wasted time looking for the perfect piece.
Also, using pieces with high amount of connections means that the open spaces next to them have to satisfy increased demands.
In reality, there are more 2- and 3- connector pieces so you will want to decrease the demands on your open spaces.

- Structural components should only help finish a ship
They're best for when you dug yourself into a hole and need to satisfy 3~4 open connections on a space.
I used to go heavy on these thinking they'd help expand my ship, but then wonder how everyone had more guns, engines, and crew than me.
I was wasting space on pieces that didn't contribute.


Things you already should be doing:
 - No open connections, or if you do, they open inwards (can't be hit by meteors)
 - Look at what the events are and build around those
 - Look at how many guns, cabins, and engines your opponents are building

Agricola V. Caverna

An eternal debate between Uwe Rosenberg's two most iconic offerings. Which is the right game for you?

Agricola
* Each player starts the game with Minor Improvement and Occupation cards -- informs your strategy and makes every game unique => high replayability
* Conversely, the randomness of the cards adds a slight element of luck. Knowing how to play your cards correctly limits the randomness factor though.
* Very tight and flavorful game; you really feel like a subsistence farmer who has to struggle to feed their family.
* High interaction between players, lots of blocking; this is a turn off to some because its competitive and cutthroat
* Scoring feels like checking things off a list rather than an achievement
* Game revolves around expanding your family, makes strategies a bit more static

Caverna
* Everything is available to everyone; myriad of options
* Easier to feed family
* Quality and quantity of components makes the game feel more complete (but increases price substantially)
* Classic engine builder
* Lower interactibility, relaxed pace => more mainstream playability
* Analysis paralysis due to the decision space
* Less importance on family growth, which expands the strategy space significantly

Personally, I like Agricola better. I think its a better designed game due to how the tightness brings the flavor to life.

In Caverna, since there's less blocking and uninformed strategy, the decision space is unboundedly huge.
This leads to massive analysis paralysis and makes the game a slog; whereas in Agricola, you don't have many options to begin with because:
- scoring is a lot more straightforward (can see what moves will gain you most points)
- you need to worry about feeding your family
- opponents already took some of the moves you wanted
So the optimal move doesn't take too long to find.

Agricola is also more replayable -- the cards keep every game unique, like a puzzle.
There is an element of luck in that regard (someone might get slightly better cards) which can be amended
by drafting the cards. While I think this randomness plays a part, I think it can be surmounted with optimal play.
In Caverna, your strategy would only change from game-to-game based on your own interest in trying something out.

There are many reasons to get Caverna over Agricola though. Caverna is an easier play -- feeding is easier,
it's less punishing for those who fall behind, it's less brutal when a spot you want gets blocked.
There's so many possibly strategies and engines due to family growth not being the primary focus
and all the rooms you can build. This makes it easier for less experienced players to do their own thing and succeed.
In Agricola, since the action space is so tight, and there is generally a small set of correct actions, more experienced players have an edge if they know these.

Caverna also plays 7; Agricola 4-5, and can pay extra to add a 6th.

In short, get Agricola if you
- want to feel the struggle of feeding your family
- have a gaming group with similar experience with Euros
- appreciate a more competitive game
- have less cash to spend

and get Caverna if you
- want to feel rewarded for building up your empire and full-on committing to a strategy
- enjoy the freedom to pursue any strategy
- want a more relaxing, low-interaction engine-builder experience
- need to support higher #s of players
